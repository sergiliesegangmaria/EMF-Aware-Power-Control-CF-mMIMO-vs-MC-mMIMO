# EMF-Aware Power Control: CF-mMIMO vs MC-mMIMO
The following numerical simulations evaluate the data rate performance of heuristic power control methods in cell-free (CF) and multi-cell (MC) mMIMO networks for DL and UL settings. The results of EMF exposure, also known as perceived user radiation, measured in terms of incident power density (DL) and specific absorption rate (UL), are also provided.

To execute the associated code, please run first all the cells in section *General* and later those of the desired scenario (*DL* or *UL*).
